# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a Friends Connect app with friends management, simulated calling, and chat messaging, styled with a vibrant dark theme using teal and coral accents.

**Planned changes:**
- Friends List screen showing friend cards with name and online/offline status badge, with an empty state when no friends exist
- Friends Management: add a friend by username, remove a friend, with all data persisted in the backend
- Simulated Call screen initiated from a friend's card, showing friend name, incrementing call timer, and mute/video toggle/end call buttons
- Chat screen per friend with scrollable chat bubble layout (sent vs. received), text input, and messages persisted in the backend
- Consistent dark background theme with teal and coral accents, rounded cards, subtle shadows, and smooth transitions across all screens

**User-visible outcome:** Users can manage a friends list, initiate a simulated voice/video call, and exchange persistent text messages with each friend, all within a cohesive dark-themed UI.
