  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements. REQ-1 (Friends List), REQ-2 (Friends Management), REQ-3 (Simulated Call Screen), REQ-4 (Simulated Chat/Messaging), and REQ-5 (visual theme) are all substantially implemented. The two required images are referenced in code but listed as omitted files due to limits, so they cannot be definitively flagged as missing. Overall implementation is comprehensive with minimal gaps.",
