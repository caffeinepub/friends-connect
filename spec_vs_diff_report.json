  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for the Internet Identity login flow (REQ-6) through wrapper/configuration logic without modifying the constrained hook files. Key changes include: AuthGuard loading spinner during isLoggingIn state, AccessDeniedScreen auto-retry on 'User is already authenticated' error, ProfileSetupModal shown for new users, and logout flow that clears React Query cache before clearing identity. Most acceptance criteria appear addressed, though some details (redirect to Friends List, no console errors) cannot be fully verified from the diff alone.",
